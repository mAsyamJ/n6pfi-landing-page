Nap Finance Protocol (NapFi) Documentation
Welcome to NapFi
NapFi is an innovative, AI-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) and creative finance protocol built primarily on the Optimism Layer 2 network. It aims to democratize finance by combining intelligent yield optimization with the tokenization of creative assets (e.g., music, art, videos, and streams), fostering transparency, inclusivity, and gamified engagement in digital economies.
As of October 19, 2025, NapFi is in active development, with a prototype vault system deployed and plans for expansion into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for global mass adoption.
This guide covers everything from the beginning to the end — starting with the origins and vision, moving through core mechanics, and ending with commercialization, challenges, and the roadmap.
________________


Section 1: The Beginning – Origins and Vision
What Problem Does NapFi Solve?
DeFi has surpassed $200 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) by 2025, but it remains plagued by complexity. Thousands of vaults and strategies (e.g., Yearn Finance’s 50+ options) confuse users with opaque risks, yields, and unclear purposes.
Meanwhile, the digital creator economy (music, YouTube, Twitch) generates $500 billion+ annually but suffers from unfair revenue splits (e.g., Spotify pays artists around 15% of royalties) and a lack of transparency between fans, labels, and investors.
NapFi bridges these two worlds by:
* Simplifying DeFi through AI-driven optimization and modular vaults.

* Tokenizing creative revenues (e.g., royalties, ad shares) for fair wealth distribution by creating Tokenized Strategy ERC-4626 and ERC-7002 (Strategy Ownership as NFTs) (exp: stTAYLOR, lpMRBEAST) or Token Launch ERC-20 ($TAYLOR, $BEAST) That is backed by L1 and L2.

* Gamifying engagement: fans stake in creator vaults for rewards, while labels and investors control strategies.

* Providing on-chain transparency and data monetization for enterprises.

________________


Core Vision
NapFi is more than a protocol — it is a DeFi operating system for the creative economy.
Founded by and developed by NapFi Labs, it merges financial automation with human creativity.
The goal: make finance adaptive, inclusive, and fun, where:
   * Creators (artists, YouTubers, streamers) retain 70%+ of revenues via tokenized vaults.

   * Fans become stakeholders, earning yields (5–12% APY) and unlocking perks such as exclusive content.

   * Labels and investors gain ownership and data insights for better decisions.

   * Platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Twitch) adopt vaults for modular, transparent ecosystems.

By 2030, NapFi aims to power over $1 T in tokenized creative assets, driving mass adoption across Digital Industries.
________________


Key Principles
      * Modularity: Vaults and strategies are plug-and-play, adaptable to any digital industry.

      * AI as Enabler, Not Core: Off-chain AI (NapFi Brain) optimizes yields and explains vaults, but the protocol’s strength lies in standardized tokenization (ERC-4626 for vaults, ERC-7002 for strategies).

      * Inclusivity: Wealth distribution (e.g., 50% to fans) and gamification lower entry barriers for non-crypto users.

      * Transparency: On-chain data tracking with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and MCP for secure AI integrations.

      * Sustainability: Optimized for Layer 2 networks (low fees, high efficiency) and compliant with regulations (e.g., GDPR via MCP encryption).

Section 2: Core Components – How NapFi Works
NapFi operates as a layered protocol: users deposit assets, AI suggests optimizations, vaults generate yields, and tokenized strategies enable ownership and control.
________________


1. User Interaction Layer (Frontend)
         * Interface: React-based web app using Tailwind CSS, Wagmi for wallet connections, and Thirdweb SDK for blockchain integration.

         * Key Flows:

            * Deposit/Withdraw: Users connect wallets (e.g., MetaMask) and deposit assets (USDC, ETH) into vaults via VaultDeFi.sol.

            * Vault Scanner: AI-powered dashboard scans for stable-growth vaults (e.g., APY > 5%, TVL > $10M).

            * Gamification: Users stake tokens for rewards (e.g., NFTs, exclusive streams). Example: In a “stTAYLOR” vault, fans stake $TAYLOR tokens for concert access.

            * UX Focus: One-click interactions to reduce friction; MCP-AI explains vaults in natural language (e.g., “This vault yields 8% via Aave with 2% impermanent loss risk.”)

________________


2. Smart Contract Layer (Blockchain Core)
               * Vault System (ERC-4626): Modular vaults manage deposits and yield generation. Implemented in VaultDeFi.sol, they tokenize deposits as ERC-4626 shares.

               * DeFi Vaults: Optimize yields across Aave, Compound, and Curve via adapters (e.g., AaveAdapter.sol, CompundAdapter.sol, CurveAdapter.sol, etc).

               * Creative Vaults: Tokenize revenues (e.g., MusicVaultFactory.sol, StreamsVaultFactory.sol, etc, deploys ERC-1155 NFTs representing fractional royalties with ERC-2981 for automated payouts and its backed by Strategy Adapter DeFi/RWA Vaults or They can make their own Strategies using VaultFactory.sol).

               * Strategy Routing: StrategyRouter.sol allocates funds based on AI recommendations (e.g., 60% to Aave).

               * Strategy Ownership (ERC-7002): Tokenizes strategy control as NFTs. Investors and labels own strategy NFTs and fans vote via $NAPFI governance tokens.

               * Utilities: SafeMath.sol, AccessControl.sol, and MockTokens.sol for security and testing.

               * Deployment: Deployed on Optimism for cost efficiency, with cross-chain expansion to Base and Polygon using Foundry deployment scripts (DeployVault.s.sol).

3. AI Integration Layer (NapFi Brain)
                  * Role: Off-chain AI (Python + FastAPI) for yield prediction, risk scoring, and strategy recommendations.

                  * Endpoints:

                     * /api/apy – Predicted yields.

                     * /api/strategy – Allocation recommendations.

                        * Integration: Uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for secure AI-blockchain communication.

                        * Data Sources: Historical APY/TVL, volatility data, and APIs such as Spotify (streams) or YouTube (views).

                        * Setup: Runs locally with python app.py; no external installation needed.

________________


4. Data and Storage Layer
                           * Storage: IPFS and NFT.Storage for NFTs; Arweave for permanent archival.

                           * Oracles: Chainlink for off-chain data feeds (e.g., YouTube views).

                           * Data Enrichment: Collects anonymized engagement metrics for enterprise analytics.

________________


End-to-End Workflow Example
                              1. A fan connects their wallet to the NapFi app and searches for “stable music vaults.”

                              2. NapFi Brain scans Spotify data and recommends the “stTAYLOR” vault (5% APY, low risk).

                              3. The fan deposits USDC into VaultDeFi.sol and receives ERC-4626 tokens.

                              4. The router allocates funds across Aave and Curve.

                              5. The fan stakes shares for exclusive NFTs; labels control splits via ERC-7002 strategy NFTs.

                              6. The vault auto-compounds yields; royalties distribute (50% fans, 30% artist).

                              7. The fan withdraws with profit; the protocol earns a 0.5–1% fee on TVL.
